# UnityShaderBibleResources

This project contains the examples and case studies related to the Unity Shader Bible book: https://glos.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1341650562
It looks like most of the examples have survived the update to Unity 6, though some prefabs must have been broken and removed at some point.
Used in combination with the book, this project will show you the stages of developing various shader effects in Unity.
Remember to reference if you use this resource to support your project development.
